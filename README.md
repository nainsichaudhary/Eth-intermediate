# ETH_Intermmediate

This contract is written on Solidity and has very basic functionalities related to the creation of decentralised Voting System.

## Description

This Smart Contract consists of simple functions and variables which helps in mapping of the data along with its minting and also helps us to burn the resources whenever needed.
## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., SafeVoting.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```javascript

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

//This is basically a demo decentralized voting system that is being implemented in the solidity language
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Proposal {
        string description;
        uint256 voteCount;
        bool exists;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public votes;
    uint256 public proposalCount;

    event ProposalCreated(uint256 proposalId, string description);
    event Voted(address indexed voter, uint256 proposalId);

    // Create a new proposal
    function createProposal(string calldata description) external {
        require(bytes(description).length > 0, "Proposal description cannot be empty");

        proposalCount++;
        proposals[proposalCount] = Proposal({
            description: description,
            voteCount: 0,
            exists: true
        });

        emit ProposalCreated(proposalCount, description);
    }

    // Vote on a proposal
    function vote(uint256 proposalId) external {
        require(proposals[proposalId].exists, "Proposal does not exist");
        require(!votes[msg.sender][proposalId], "You have already voted on this proposal");

        proposals[proposalId].voteCount++;
        votes[msg.sender][proposalId] = true;

        emit Voted(msg.sender, proposalId);

        // Ensure the voteCount is incremented correctly
        assert(proposals[proposalId].voteCount > 0);
    }

    // Check the vote count of a proposal
    function getVoteCount(uint256 proposalId) external view returns (uint256) {
        require(proposals[proposalId].exists, "Proposal does not exist");
        return proposals[proposalId].voteCount;
    }

    // Example function using revert() statement
    function exampleRevert() external pure {
        // Revert with a custom error message
        revert("Trnsaction Reverted");
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        revert("Direct payments not allowed");
    }

    receive() external payable {
        revert("Direct payments not allowed");
    }
}

```

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.7" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile SafeVoting.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "HelloWorld" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Now inorder for the Deployment to work we have to enter a valid ProposalDescription and then create on the CreateProposal Button and after that we can enter a proposal ID to vote for in the Vote field . The value of Proposal ID is generated by default according to the creation of the Proposals i.e 1,2,3............ and so on . Now if we want to check the number of proposals creaetd till date then we can click on proposalCount button and if we want to check whether a particular proposal has votes or not we can do so by entering the proposal ID in the getVoteCount field. Moreover, if we want to check about the proposal description then we can enter the proposal ID in the proposal field . It will display the description along with the number of votes and whether that particular proposal exists or not.
